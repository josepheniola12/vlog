    <h1 style="font-family:Impact;font-weight:bold">How do i start the affiliate bussiness?</h1><br>
    <dd  style="font-family:calibri;font-weight:bold">very good question; an affiliate marketer is a person who advertise bussinesses
        and earn commission, for example i produce tooth-paste, and i need people to buy my product , i will need to hire an affiliate marketer to help me market it, so that people will patronize my market
        i will pay the affiliate marketer money to help me market my bussiness, without marketing your bussiness, your bussiness can't get recognize to the consumers.
        Now that we have the advance technology, we all see bussinesses online, so what the affiliate marketer do is to share the bussiness link to people or make a short video about the bussiness and attaching the bussiness link to the video description, in order for them to get it.

    <marquee style="background-color:#c00800;color:white;font-family: Calibri">BONAZA BONAZA!!....Advertise your bussiness for free! be a bussiness tycoon.  Headline News The history of Nigeria can be traced back to the early Stone Age. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area was inhabited by hunter-gatherers as early as 9000 BC. The Nok culture emerged in the region around 1000 BC and left behind terracotta sculptures and iron tools. The Nok culture is believed to have been the earliest in West Africa.

By the 11th century, the Yoruba people had established the Oyo and Benin kingdoms in the region. The Yoruba people were known for their strong trading networks and their advanced agricultural methods.

In the 15th century, the region was colonized by the Songhai Empire, which brought Islam to the region. In the late 16th century, the region was colonized by the British. The British established a protectorate in the region in 1900 and the region was formally annexed in 1914.

In 1960, Nigeria gained its independence from Britain and became a republic. Since then, Nigeria has experienced a series of military coups and civil wars. The most recent of these was the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-1970.

Today, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and one of the most populous countries in the world. It is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation and is home to over 500 ethnic groups and over 250 languages. Nigeria is a major oil producer and is one of the world's fastest growing economies.</marquee>
